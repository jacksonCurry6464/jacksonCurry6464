### Hi there 👋  My name is Jackson Curry, welcome to my professional portfolio github account!  
I am currently an Applied Mathematics Master's Student working in Hodge Research lab at the University of Colorado Boulder.  I am determined to use my math and programming skills to advance the field of renewable energy and promote sustainability! 

I am currently working on a case study using traffic and power grid data from Greensboro North Carolina provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL).  I am using this data to forecast power system upgrades that will be need to be made to the power grid, as well as solve optimization problems surrounding the placement of Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer Stations.

Other interests of mine include robotics, natural language processing, image processing, and forecasting problems!

On this account you can find the final products and demos of many of the projects I have worked on.  I generally use my school https://github.com/jacu9585real account while I am collaborating with others to build these projects so feel free to take a look over there to see more projects in progress.
