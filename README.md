### Hi there 👋  My name is Jackson Curry (He/Him/His), welcome to my professional portfolio github account!  
I am currently working ot develop awesome grid modelling tools with my team Kevala Analytics based in San Francisco.  I am determined to use my math, cloud computing, and programming skills to advance the field of renewable energy ☀️ and decarbonize the power grid🌱 ! 
📫 How to reach me: jacksoncurry6464@gmail.com or www.linkedin.com/in/jacksoncurry6464


During my masters degree program at CU Boulder, I worked on a case study using traffic 🚗 and power grid ⚡ data from Greensboro North Carolina provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL).  I am using this data to forecast power system upgrades that will be need to be made to the power grid, as well as solve optimization problems surrounding the placement of Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer Stations.

Other interests I am looking to collaborate🧑‍🤝‍🧑 on are natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning with robotic agents 🤖, and optimization/modelling problems.  

Check out some visual demos from my work in the video 🎬 below!

On this account you can find the final products and demos of many of the projects I have worked on.  I generally use my school https://github.com/jacu9585real account while I am collaborating with others to build these projects so feel free to take a look over there to see more projects in progress.
